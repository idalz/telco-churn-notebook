## Project Overview
Analyzing the provided data to gain insights and create a classification model for predicting customer churn.

## Project Workflow

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Explore, manipulate, and visualize the data to gain insights.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Apply techniques like one-hot encoding, scaling, and SMOTE resampling to prepare the data.

3. **Model Selection**
   - Assess models using both normal and upsampled data.

4. **Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning**
   - Utilize GridSearchCV for optimizing the best models and conducting thorough evaluations.
